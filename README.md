| **Monetised GHG Emissions Explorer**            | Allows the user to see charts depicting the effect of monetising greenhouse gas emissions and comparing it against profitability.   | [![View on Streamlit](https://img.shields.io/badge/View%20on-Streamlit-brightgreen?logo=streamlit)](https://ghgexplorer.streamlit.app/) |
| **Sustainability Report Data Extraction Tool**   |  This tool takes sustainability disclosure PDFs, identifies the page ranges containing greenhouse gas emissions data, merges those, and exports a streamlined data-rich report.    |  [![View on Streamlit](https://img.shields.io/badge/View%20on-Streamlit-brightgreen?logo=streamlit)](https://ghgdataextractor.streamlit.app/)  |
| **IFVI value factors database - data visualisation tool** |  This tool provides table visualizations of the Global Value Factors Database released by the International Foundation for Valuing Impacts in late 2024.    |  [![View on Streamlit](https://img.shields.io/badge/View%20on-Streamlit-brightgreen?logo=streamlit)](https://valuefactorsddatavis.streamlit.app/)  |
| **GHG Emissions Calculator**                     |   This simulator/calculator allows the user to input greenhouse gas emissions data across scopes one, two, and three, monetizes them at a rate proposed by an organization, and then compares the monetized data against profitability.  | [![View on Hugging Face Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/View%20on-Hugging%20Face%20Spaces-blue?logo=huggingface)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/danielrosehill/Monetised-GHG-Emissions-Calculator) |
